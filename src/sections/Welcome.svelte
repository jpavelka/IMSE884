</Heading>

As the name suggests, the aim of this course is to give an <Key>overview of the related fields of integer programming and combinatorial optimization</Key>, which together comprise a large portion of the <Key>best-studied and most widely-applicable problems</Key> in optimization and mathematical programming. <Key>We will lean more heavily on the theoretical aspects</Key> of the subject, spending most of our time on theory and algorithms that allow solutions to be found to these important problems. We will devote a relatively smaller amount of time to building and solving these types of models in practice.

As far as prerequisites, you should have some <Key>familiarity with linear algebra</Key>, at a minimum the basic mechanics of <Key>matrix math (addition/multiplication)</Key>. Topics such as linear rank and determinants with surface as well. Some familiarity with other optimization topics, especially <Key>linear programming</Key>, will also prove helpful.

We will begin the class by by <Key>exploring a selection of different combinatorial optimization problems</Key> and specialized algorithms for solving them. We'll then discuss <Key>preliminaries on integer programming</Key>, which we will see can itself be used as a tool for combinatorial optimization (as well as other types of problems).

In these discussions, we'll begin to notice how <Key>some problems seem to require more resources</Key> than others while modeling and solving them. This will motivate a <Key>discussion on computational complexity</Key>. We will not develop this topic completely formally, but at least at enough depth to help frame our discussions on what problems may be easier to solve than others.

From there, we'll take a deep dive into the <Key>theory of solving integer programs</Key>. We'll need to start with a <Key>review<Footnote>
    I expect that most of you taking this course have studied linear programming before. But don't worry too much of that's not the case, as we'll touch on all the theory we need during the review.
</Footnote> of linear programming</Key> and polyhedra. This will allow us to discuss the main integer programming techniques of <Key>cutting planes and branch-and-bound</Key>. From there we will cover some more <Key>specialized solving techniques</Key>, and spend some time discussing practical matters of <Key>solving integer programs in real-life</Key> applications.

    <span slot=context>Useful resources for students.</span>
</Heading>

The core of <Key>this course will be taught from these notes</Key>, thus students are <Key>not strictly required to obtain a separate textbook</Key>. But I will strongly suggest anyone taking the course find a copy of the second edition to Laurence Wolsey's book <Key><em>Integer Programming</em> <CitationRef refId=wolsey2020/>. A large portion of this course</Key>'s content is derived from this book (although we'll present things in a slightly different order), and you'll find further details there not covered in the notes.

There are a few other sources that I recommend, whose contents is woven into this course. I have to start with the book <Key><em>Integer and Combinatorial Optimization</em> <CitationRef refId=nemWol2014/></Key>, written by Wolsey along with George Nemhauser, which is <Key>potentially <em>the</em> reference for this subject<Footnote>
    Why didn't I choose <CitationRef refId=nemWol2014/> as the course text? I think the presentation and level of <CitationRef refId=wolsey2020/> is a little better suited for this course. It's also a bit newer, and although the theory found in <CitationRef refId=nemWol2014/> is evergreen, <CitationRef refId=wolsey2020/> contains a bit more updated information on techniques used by solvers in practice today.
</Footnote></Key>. Two books written by Alexander Schrijver, <em>Theory of Linear and Integer Programming</em> <CitationRef refId=schrijver1998theory/> and <em>Combinatorial Optimization: Polyhedra and Efficiency</em> <CitationRef refId=schrijver2003combOpt/>, are excellect resources and cover the subject at an impressive depth (though the writing style is rather terse, and can be a little challenging for readers that are new to the subject). On the less theoretical, more practical side is Williams' book <em>Model Building in Mathematical Programming</em> <CitationRef refId=williams2013model/>, which gives several examples of taking real-world problems and modeling them to be solved as integer programs (as well as other types of optimization problesm).

I have an irrational aversion to paper and think digital formats have so much more to offer. But I <Key>couldn't find a digital note-creating system that had the features I wanted, so I built my own</Key>. The result is what you're seeing now. These notes will display and generally work <Key>better on wider screens</Key> (e.g. a computer monitor/laptop/tablet as opposed to your phone), but can be accessed by anything with a web browser. If physical copies are your thing, you can <Key>print these notes from your browser</Key>. From what I've seen, Chrome and Edge will create a decent PDF through their default print utility, while Firefox was lacking. <Key>Your mileage may vary</Key>.

Additionally, <Key>I'd love to hear your feedback on the notes!</Key> That means both content (the notes are almost surely littered with typos and unclear wordings) and user experience. If you find mistakes or have any ideas for how to make the notes better, I'd love to hear about them! (Though I'm only a hack of a web developer, so my ability to deliver on any of your technical suggestions may be limited.) I will be keeping track of who has contributed to improving these notes, and will have a prize at the end of the semester for the student(s) responsible for the most/best improvements.

    Why I love this stuff (and you might too!)
    <span slot=context>Sharing my own journey in learning combinatorial optimization and integer programming.</span>
</Heading>

Alright, admin stuff is over, now's the time we'd usually jump right into the meat of the course. Except I'd like to step back a little. Before we step into it, I'd like to give you a sense for why we bother teaching this stuff anyway. Personally, I find this subject endlessly fascinating in its own right. I get enjoyment out of the inherent puzzle-like nature of the problems we're solving, and I imagine several of you will join me in this. I also marvel in the beauty of the math underlying the techniques we'll be using, and while I suspect that feeling is less universal, I hope to pull at least a few of you in there as well ðŸ˜Š.

But even beyond personal preferences, this stuff is seriously useful in the real world. Businesses from various industries around the world use these techniques every day, with the combined benefits easily topping billions of dollars annually. So even if you don't <em>love</em> this stuff quite like me, the applicability of the techniques is inarguable.

    Fun and games
</Heading>

Do you enjoy puzzle games? I'm particularly thinking about games like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku>sudoku</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire>peg solitaire</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)>rush hour</a>, or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)>minesweeper</a>. The kind of game with simple rules and a clear goal that require you to think through some logic or sequence of steps to accomplish the goal. There are no opponents, no physical skills to master, and luck plays little to no role in the outcome. It's just you and wits trying to solve the puzzle.

I happen to adore these kinds of games. As a kid, I could spend hours getting lost in them. Fast-forward to my college years, and I'm taking my first class in combinatorial optimization<Footnote>Though maybe it was a graph theory class? I don't remember exactly, some of the material overlaps.</Footnote>. I find that lots of the problems we're studying scratch the same itch as those puzzle games.

Want an example? Let's go ahead and define one right now, though don't worry about reading it in detail yet.

<Problem refId=maxWeightIndSet>
    <span slot=name>Maximum Weight Independent Set Problem</span>
    <span slot=instance>
        Graph $$G=(V,E)$$, non-negative vertex weights $$w_{v}\in\R_{\geq0}$$ for each $$v \in V$$.
    </span>
    <span slot=problem>
        Find a subset of the vertices $$V'\subseteq V$$ where no two vertices in $$V'$$ are adjacent, such that the sum $$\sum_{v\in V'}w_v$$ is maximized. That is, find
        <MathDisp>
            \argmax_{V'\subseteq V}\left\{\sum_{v\in V'}w_v:(u,v)\not\in E\ \forall\ u,v\in V'\right\}
        </MathDisp>
    </span>
</Problem>

Excited yet? No? Well, I wouldn't have been the first time I saw this either. Luckily the professor didn't introduce it like that. Instead, he went to the whiteboard and drew something like <FigureRef refId=indSetEx/>.

<Figure refId=indSetEx>
    <InteractiveIndependentSet
        nodes={indSetNodes}
        edges={indSetEdges}
        seed={indSetSeed}
    />
    <span slot=caption>An example <ProblemRef refId=maxWeightIndSet/></span>
</Figure>

Each of the circles represents a vertex in the graph, and a line drawn between vertices is an edge. There are two pieces of information given inside the vertices. First is the name of the vertex, some letter of the alphabet. Next is the weight associated with the vertex. So, on the far-left of the diagram is vertex $$a$$, whose weight is 3. Then you see vertex $$b$$ with weight 6, and so on.

The game is to create a so-called <Definition refId=independentSet>
    independent set
    <span slot=definition>
        In <DefinitionRef refId=graphTheory/>, a subset $$V'\subseteq V$$ of the vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent.
    </span>
</Definition> (also known as a <Definition refId=stableSet>stable set<span slot=definition>See <DefinitionRef refId=independentSet/>.</span></Definition>) of vertices, i.e. a subset $$V'\subseteq V$$ of the vertices such that no two vertices in $$V'$$ are adjacent. Importantly, you'd like the sum of the weights of vertices in $$V'$$ to be as high as possible.

For example, the set $$\{b\}$$ is an independent set with weight 6. The set $$\{b, f\}$$ is also an independent set, and a better one in the context of the game since the total weight of that set is 12 (6 for $$b$$ and 6 for $$f$$). The set $$\{b,f,g\}$$ has weight 15, but it doesn't count for our game since $$f$$ and $$g$$ are adjacent, and hence the set is not independent.

Got the idea? Go ahead and try to find the best independent set you can!
